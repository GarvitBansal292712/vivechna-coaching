          At Vivechna, we provide ample opportunity for students to review
          sample videos and course content before admission to ensure that the
          course meets their expectations. Once you have taken admission, a
          refund will only be considered if you have not viewed any of the
          lectures.
          <br />
          <br />
          Refund requests will be processed only if the institute decides not to
          continue a course. In such cases, the service tax charged over the
          course will be deducted from the refund amount.
          <br />
          <br />
          We recommend that students carefully evaluate the course content
          before making a final commitment to ensure complete satisfaction with
          their choice.
